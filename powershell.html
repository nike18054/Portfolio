      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Taking an OEM image to a Base image script</h1>
      <hr>
      <h4>
        &nbsp;I created this script to automate the process of creating a base build image on a new machine.
        At my workplace I am set with the responsibilities of applying base images on new machines we recieve including desktops, laptops, and tablets.
        Once the base image is applied, we can add it to the domain and apply a few other things to get it ready for deployment.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        &nbsp;This script consist of a package type script and an automated sysprep script. Prior to creating this script there were a few other
        scripts we had to execute and searching the network for them was a pain. So I decided to package many scripts together in one script so it
        simplifies the process and reduces room for human error.

        &nbsp;Before starting, I am using a .NET Framework Class called System.Windows which requires an assembly. You can use this code to use the class.

        <b>Step 1:</b> Only allowing local administrator to use script.
      </h3>
      <h4>
        For this script I automated everything down to the sysprep process. At my workplace we use a few local accounts for managing the machine if it cannot connect
        to the domain. When creating the base image we use one of the local accounts. We want to still use that local account after running sysprep. After
        we run sysprep through OOBE it will ask us who is using this computer and it will prompt you to enter a username. You can not use the same username if you
        don't delete it prior to running sysprep. For this reason I enable the local administrator account and log into it prior to running this script.
        This block of code will not allow the script to execute unless you are logged in as the local administrator account.

        Earlier on I mentioned the local users we use to manage the machine. Well we want to make sure we delete the user before running sysprep.
        If we do not delete the user before running sysprep it will keep the users profile cached and not allow us to use the account when going through
        the OOBE. If you try using the same user the machine will throw and error like <i>This user is already created</i>.
        This is a problem because we will have to create an alternative local account and do additional configurations when going through the deployment process.
        We need to delete the user in two places; advanced system properties (windows + pause/break) &amp; local user and group manager (lusrmgr.msc).
